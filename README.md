# CRED
Cred Data Analysis in SQL involves examining user transaction data collected by the Cred application to extract insights and make informed decisions. 
By querying and analyzing this data using SQL, valuable information can be gleaned, such as patterns in spending behavior, popular payment categories,
user engagement, and trends over time. SQL queries can help identify top spenders, analyze payment frequencies, assess credit card utilization, and 
track user growth. This analysis enables Cred to enhance its services, tailor rewards, and offer targeted financial products to its users
based on their preferences and behaviors.
